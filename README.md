# Seattle-Airbnb-Udacity-Project

As part of the Udacity data science nanodegree course, I have to analyse the Airbnb Seattle dataset for 2016 following the CRISP-DM process.

## Contents:
Jupyter notebook named:__Airbnb Seattle__ containing an analysis on Airbnb's Seattle dataset.

## Business questions:
  Which listings are charging the highest price?<br>
  What is the average monthly price charged?<br>
  How much time does the host take to respond?<br>
  Which are the popular neighbourhoods?<br>
  Which are the most expensive and cheapest neighbourhoods in Seattle?<br>
  What review ratings affect the customer?<br>
  Does availability of certain amenities fetch a higher price?<br>

## Evaluating results:
The results and evaluations are included in the jupyter notebook. A detailed overview of the results is posted on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@sanjanasharma/se-a-ttle-in-a-data-story-aac4da348f37)

### Some findings on the business questions below :<br>
  * Listing #7733192 charged the highest price- c$1,000<br>
  * Average price charged- $92 (Price breakdown by month in the notebook) June and December months are the peak price months <br>
  * Time taken by host to respond- c45% respond within an hour <br>
  * For maximizing revenue and bookings -Southeast Magnolia was the most expensive locality and Broadway the most popular.<br>
  * Cleanliness and good communication from the host  affects the overall ratings. <br>
