# Seattle-Airbnb-Udacity-Project

As part of the Udacity data science nanodegree course, I have to analyse the Airbnb Seattle dataset for 2016 following the CRISP-DM process.

## Contents:
Jupyter notebook named:__Airbnb Seattle__ containing an analysis on Airbnb's Seattle dataset.

## Business questions:
  Which listings are charging the highest price?<br>
  What is the average monthly price charged?<br>
  How much time does the host take to respond?<br>
  Which are the popular neighbourhoods?<br>
  Which are the most expensive and cheapest neighbourhoods in Seattle?<br>
  What review ratings affect the customer?<br>
  Does availability of certain amenities fetch a higher price?<br>

## Evaluating results:
The results and evluations are included in the jupyter notebook.

## Packages used:
Numpy<br>
Pandas<br>
Matplotlib
